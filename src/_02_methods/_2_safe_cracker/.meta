  # Safe Cracker


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/safeCracker.jpg"/>


  ## Goal:


  Method calls - call a method passing a parameter. Your mission: use the tryCode
  method to crack the safe by trying all possible numbers.


  ## Steps:


  1. Create a for loop that will repeat until the program ends.

  2. Inside the loop, call the tryCode method using the for loop variable for the
  code.

  3. The tryCode method will end the program when the correct code is guessed.

  4. Run the program and see all the guesses being printed to the console.

  5. Bonus: Can you change the loop so that the safe will be cracked more quickly?
