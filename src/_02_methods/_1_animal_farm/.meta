  # Animal Farm


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/animalFarm.jpg"/>


  ## Goal:


  Method calls. Call a method that shows an image and makes the sound of an animal
  as selected by the user in a pop-up.


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user to enter the name of an animal on this farm.

  2. Use if statements to call the method that matches the animal they chose.

  3. Loop the program so the user can choose more than one time.

  4. Test your code to make sure all animal choices work correctly.

  5. What happens if the user does not enter the name of an animal on the farm?
