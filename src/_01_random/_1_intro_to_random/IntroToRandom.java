		// But what if you don't want the range to start at 0?  Let's say we want numbers between 25 and 75 inclusive.
		// In this case, 25 is the lowest value we want, and 75 is the highest value. See below how to do this:
		
		for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {
			// Uncomment the line of code below, and replace (_____)  with   (highest value - lowest value + 1)
			// For our example, this will be:  ( 75 - 25 + 1 )
			// Also replace <lowest value> with the start of the range.  For our example, this is 25.
			
			// number = ran.nextInt(_____) + <lowest value>;
			System.out.println(number);
			
		}
		// This time, all the values printed should be between 25 and 75.

		
		/*************  Random integers with an upper and lower (negative) limit  *************/
		
		// Using the above example, generate 5 random numbers between -222 and 88
